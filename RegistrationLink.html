<p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
document written in a markup language such as HTML
 .CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
It describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
Simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
CSS is easy to learn and understood, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>
